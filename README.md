# Multi-frame analysis prevents false positives
eye_history_length = 15  # frames
```

### Performance
- **Real-time tracking** - 30 FPS camera feed
- **Low CPU usage** - Optimized detection algorithms
- **Minimal memory** - < 100MB typical usage
- **Responsive UI** - Smooth scrolling and animations
